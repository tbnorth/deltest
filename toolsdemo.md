# Tools for tools

 - Visualization technologies are important for interpreting big data generated
   by new monitoring tools.  Visualization technology is itself an important tool.

# Drifters

 - Verify models
 - Collect fine scale data
 - Work in shallow environments
 - Outreach tool
 - Low cost, swarm of data collectors

## Visualization issues

 - review data with ability to see larger patterns
 - select "clean" sections of data
 - measure speeds, export sections

# Glider

 - high frequency data, millions of observations
 - tow data from ship can be visualized the same way
 - position in space and time relative to other things
 - multiple gliders, reconstruct 3D extent of plumes etc.

## Visualization issues

 - glider moves relatively slowly, temporal component of data important
 - 3D structure in data
 - overview of big data with ability to drill down

# Agents

 - Now-casting current source of nearshore waters
 - Potential for interactive app. for managers
 
## Visualization issues

 - public app. may use same interface, provide data and allow exploration of
   how the system works

# Nearshore model

 - Simplicity for transparency, measured inputs rather than calibrations
 - Relatively low cost of deployment

## Visualization issues

 - visualization interface accelerates development / debugging
 - review observations against model in context of neighbors / pattern in model
