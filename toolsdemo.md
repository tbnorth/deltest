# Drifters

 - Verify models
 - Collect fine scale data
 - Work in shallow environments
 - Outreach tool
 - Low cost, swarm of data collectors

# Glider

 - high frequency data, millions of observations
 - tow data from ship can be visualized the same way
 - position in space and time relative to other things
 - multiple gliders, reconstruct 3D extent of plumes etc.

# Agents

 - Nowcasting current source of nearshore waters
 - Potential for interactive app. for managers
 
# Nearshore model

 - Simplicity for transparency, measured inputs rather than calibrations
 - Relatively low cost of deployment
 - Visualization interface accelerates development
